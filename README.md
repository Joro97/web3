# web3
A repository hosting my web3 work and research. It will be divided by 3 main folders:
  1. Security-Portfolio. This will hold a list of my growing audit reports and contests findings , starting with some First Flights
  2. CTF - my solutions to famous CTF tasks like DamnVulnerable DeFi and Ethernaut
  3. Courses - Homework solutions and any other interesting mini projects that I do as part of some courses or just for learning
